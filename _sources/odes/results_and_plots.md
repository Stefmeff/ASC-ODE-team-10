# Numerical results and plots

This section summarizes the main numerical results of the
[ASC-ODE – Team 10](https://github.com/Stefmeff/ASC-ODE-team-10) project and
shows representative plots generated by the code.

The C++ demos and Python plotting scripts live in the Team 10 repo:

- Repository: <https://github.com/Stefmeff/ASC-ODE-team-10>
- Numeric outputs: `outputs/` and subfolders
- Plots:
  - `outputs/plots/` (mass–spring, Legendre polynomials, etc.)
  - `outputs/ElectricNetwork/plots/` (electric network / RC circuit)

Below we embed the plots directly from the GitHub repository.

## Mass–spring system

The **mass–spring system** is treated with explicit and implicit time-stepping
methods (Explicit Euler, Improved Euler, Implicit Euler, Crank–Nicolson) as
described in the course JupyterBook.

We vary the number of time steps \(N\) (with \( \Delta t = T / N \)) and inspect:

- Position–time diagrams \(x(t)\),
- Phase plots \((x, v)\).
